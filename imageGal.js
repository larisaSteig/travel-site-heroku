Many visitors come only for the main event: Las Vegas. Nevada's twinkling desert jewel is a mecca for pleasure-seekers, and where privilege and poverty collide and three-quarters of the state's population resides.",

And, as the cradle of Western civilization, it has some of the world's greatest ancient monuments. While it's a late bloomer in the modern age and retains echoes of a simpler, time-passed world, contemporary Greece has one of Europe's fastest-changing cultural landscapes. With its classical past, hang-loose present, and edgy future, Greece offers something for every traveler.",

This destination is also worth a detour in the spring with its Spring Markets and numerous cultural events such as the 'Culture and Music' Festival. What about summer and autumn? These seasons are perfect for a ride in a tourist bus in the surrounding villages of Eguisheim, Riquewihr or Ribeauvillé. You can drive along the wine route and visit some wine estates or simply stroll among the vineyards.",

You can describe what you see; a drying of landscape, a browning of land and a slow disappearing of trees and shrubs and signs of life. Before, all of a sudden, the dunes appear. A sea of golden waves that appears to have no beginning and no end. You can show pictures and write words but portraying that feeling is harder. Perhaps it’s one of those things, like seeing the ocean for the first time, that you need to experience for yourself.",

Peru is peppered with Incan sites, but none so famous as the 'lost city' of Machu Picchu, whose breathtaking image seems to grace every brochure and travel book. ",
